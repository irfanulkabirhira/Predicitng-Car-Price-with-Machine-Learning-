# Predicitng-Car-Price-with-Machine-Learning-
This project focuses on predicting car prices based on various features using machine learning techniques, with a particular emphasis on Decision Tree regression. It is a comprehensive workflow that demonstrates the entire process of building a predictive model, from data preparation to model evaluation.

1. Predicting Car Prices:
   - Task: Build a regression model to predict the price of cars based on other features in the dataset. This could involve preprocessing the data, selecting relevant features, and implementing regression algorithms.

2. Feature Engineering:
   - Task: Challenge students to come up with creative ways to engineer new features from the existing ones. For example, they could create a new feature representing the ratio of horsepower to curb weight.

3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
   - Task: Have students perform in-depth exploratory data analysis to understand the relationships between different features. Visualization tools can be used to communicate their findings effectively.

4. Handling Missing Data:
   - Task: Teach students how to handle missing data in a dataset. They can explore different strategies such as imputation or removal of missing values.

5. Training:
   - Task: Use relavant ML Models

6. Model evaluation:
- Evaluate models and Summarizing their findings. This should include a clear explanation of the model's performance and any insights gained from the analysis.
